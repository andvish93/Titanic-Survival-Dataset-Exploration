Titanic Plan <3

Nov. 13th Notes (use the file that anand file (its in the link in github), work on fare and age then try a heat map, and maybe training SVM!)
decisions:
	fare: round up or down
	Split: PClass, sex, Embarked
	age: impute, using some other features
		w1() + w2() + w3()â€¦
	Ignore: passenger ID
	name: maybe using the last name, or just ignore it
	
	Cabin:
		split into letter and integer, then see if there is any correlation with the target.
